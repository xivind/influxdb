Once InfluxDB is set up and receives data over Mosquitto from the containers that retrieve data from Strava, Fitbit, Nilu and Yr, the data can easily be visualised in Grafana. Just set up [InfluxDB as datasource](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/add-a-data-source/) and create the diagrams that suits you. Some examples below
